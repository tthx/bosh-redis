- Added pre-start and pre-stop in Redis job to support BOSH recreate and Redis Cluster high availability. Your deployment must be serial and having a persistent storage to support this feature.
- Components update:
  - [*Redis*](https://redis.io/) 5.0.7 -> 5.0.10
  - [*redis_exporter*](https://github.com/oliver006/redis_exporter) 1.3.5 -> 1.16.0

## redis-orange 1.0.2.1
- Correction for misunderstanding about Sentinel's quorum by adding `max_detected_failures` property in Redis's specifications. It's default value is 2.

## redis-orange 1.0.2
- Refine Redis memory usage by `maxmemory` property and memory eviction policies.
- Delay automatic restart to avoid persistence on disk to deal with the issue:
> [If you are using replication, make sure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restarts on crashes: replicas will try to be an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.](https://redis.io/topics/admin)
- Add redis_sentinel_exporter to monitor Redis Sentinel with Prometheus.
- RDB persistence was enabled by default. Since this release, no persistence (i.e. no RDB neither AOF)is the default and, by default, diskless is used for replication.
- `CONFIG REWRITE failed: Permission denied` in Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster with High Availability is fixed.
- Update [*Spring Boot*](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 2.2.1 -> 2.2.2.
